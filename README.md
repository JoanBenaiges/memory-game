Memory Game

Welcome to the Memory Game! This project is a simple implementation of a memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

About the Project
This memory game presents a grid of cards, each featuring an image of a superhero. The objective of the game is to find all pairs of matching cards by flipping them over two at a time. If two flipped cards match, they remain face-up; otherwise, they flip back face-down. The game keeps track of the number of pairs clicked and guessed. The game ends when all pairs are matched.

Technologies Used
HTML
Structure: The HTML file (index.html) provides the structure of the web page, including elements such as the game title, score display, memory board, and script references.
CSS
Styling: CSS stylesheets (style.css) are used to define the appearance of various elements, including card layout, game board, and score display.
JavaScript
Game Logic: JavaScript files (memory.js and index.js) contain the game logic, including card shuffling, card flipping, pair matching, and game completion checking.
Event Handling: Event listeners are used to handle user clicks on cards and update the game state accordingly.
DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated to dynamically generate card elements and update the score display during gameplay.
